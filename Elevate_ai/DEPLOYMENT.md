# Elevate.AI Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions for deploying the Elevate.AI application to various cloud platforms.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

1. A working Elevate.AI application (tested locally)
2. A Groq API key
3. An account on your chosen cloud platform
4. Git repository with your application code

## Deployment Options

### 1. Render

[Render](https://render.com/) offers a simple deployment process for Flask applications.

#### Steps for Render Deployment:

1. Create a new Web Service on Render
2. Connect your Git repository
3. Configure the service:
   - **Name**: `elevate-ai` (or your preferred name)
   - **Environment**: Python
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `gunicorn app:app`
4. Add environment variables:
   - `GROQ_API_KEY`: Your Groq API key
   - `FLASK_ENV`: production
   - `DATABASE_PATH`: /var/data/database.db
5. Create a persistent disk for the database:
   - Mount path: `/var/data`
   - Size: 1 GB (minimum)
6. Deploy the service

### 2. Heroku

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a popular platform for deploying Flask applications.

#### Steps for Heroku Deployment:

1. Install the Heroku CLI and log in
2. Navigate to your project directory
3. Create a `Procfile` with the following content:
   ```
   web: gunicorn app:app
   ```
4. Initialize a Git repository (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
5. Create a Heroku app:
   ```bash
   heroku create elevate-ai
   ```
6. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   heroku config:set GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   heroku config:set FLASK_ENV=production
   ```
7. Deploy to Heroku:
   ```bash
   git push heroku main
   ```
8. Set up a PostgreSQL database (optional, for production):
   ```bash
   heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
   ```

### 3. Railway

[Railway](https://railway.app/) is a modern platform for deploying applications.

#### Steps for Railway Deployment:

1. Create a new project on Railway
2. Connect your Git repository
3. Add a new service using your repository
4. Add environment variables:
   - `GROQ_API_KEY`: Your Groq API key
   - `FLASK_ENV`: production
   - `PORT`: 5000
5. Deploy the service

## Production Considerations

### Database

For production deployments, consider using a more robust database solution:

- **SQLite**: Suitable for low-traffic applications, but requires persistent storage
- **PostgreSQL**: Recommended for higher traffic or when you need more advanced features

### Security

1. Always use HTTPS in production
2. Keep your Groq API key secure
3. Set up proper authentication if handling sensitive data
4. Regularly update dependencies

### Scaling

1. Use a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn
2. Consider adding a reverse proxy like Nginx for high-traffic applications
3. Implement caching for frequently accessed data

## Monitoring

1. Set up logging to monitor application performance
2. Use the platform's monitoring tools to track resource usage
3. Implement error tracking with services like Sentry

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Application crashes on startup**: Check logs for errors, verify environment variables
2. **Database connection issues**: Ensure database path is correct and accessible
3. **API rate limiting**: Monitor Groq API usage and implement rate limiting if necessary

## Maintenance

1. Regularly update dependencies
2. Monitor application logs for errors
3. Back up your database regularly
